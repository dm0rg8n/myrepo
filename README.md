# myrepo
testing my setup

A line I wrote on my local computer

README.md Adding another line to check the cache

“This is a line from RStudio”

Testing this again, hopefully it works!

Julis comment: If you want line breaks in `.md`, you have to use two returns. Also: How about a nice pull request for you to handle? :-)
